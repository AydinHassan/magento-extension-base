## Installation

This module is installable via `Composer`. If you have used the Magento Skeleton as a base module then you can just require this project and all the rest is done for you.

Note: As these repositories are currently private and not available via a public pakage list like [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) Or [Firegento](http://packages.firegento.com) you need to add the repository to the projects `composer.json` before you require the project.

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "{{REPO}}"
    }
],
```

```
$ cd {{REPOFOLDER}}
$ composer require "{{PACKAGENAME}}"
```
